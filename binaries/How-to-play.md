# How to play

For the best experience I recommend using XBOX Controllers. All player can play with a controller. It is also only possible to play as four when you got controllers.
- R2 to accelerate
- L2 to brake
- Y to use your item

or else you can just play as two

Keyboard players:
- 1st player WASD + E for item usage
- 2nd player Arrow key + numpad 0 for item
